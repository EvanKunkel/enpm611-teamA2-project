# ENPM611 Project Team A2

This project contains a set of analytical tools that can be used to generate insights on issues in the [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) github repository.

## Team Members

- Sumiran Jaiswal
- Evan Kunkel
- Ayushi Patel
- Pranav Raveendran

## Install dependencies

In the root directory of the application, create a virtual environment, activate that environment, and install the dependencies like so:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run an analysis

With everything set up, you should be able to run the existing example analysis:

```
python run.py --feature 0
```

That will output basic information about the issues to the command line and plot a bar graph showing the top 50 issue creators by number of issues they created.

### Analysis One:

This analysis focuses on issue activity by their state (Open vs. Closed), providing insights into the project's maintenance trends and potential backlogs. The feature can be run using:

```bash
python run.py --feature 1
```

#### Key Highlights

- **Categorization**: Differentiates issues into Open and Closed states for better insights.
- **Visualization**: Outputs a pie chart to visualize the distribution of Open and Closed issues.
- **Modular Design**: Built using the `IssueStateAnalysis` class for flexibility and reusability.
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly added via the `--feature 1` flag in the CLI.

#### Benefits

- **Enhanced Insights**: Quickly identify backlogs and unresolved issues.
- **Actionable Focus**: Visual summaries make decision-making easier.
- **Future-Ready**: Scalable design for additional analysis and customizations.

### Analysis Two:

The second feature provides insights on the issues based off of their labels. The basic capabilities of the feature can be ran with the following command:
```
python run.py --feature 2
```
Additional insights can be generated by passing a label as an argument, as follows:
```
python run.py --feature 2 --label LABEL_NAME
```
where `LABEL_NAME` is the name of the label (e.g. `"Bug"` or `"New Feature"`).

The feature provides the following analytics.
- Simple Label Analysis
  - Calculates the total number of labels amongst all issues
  - Finds the number of issues with the user inputted label (all by default)
- Plot of Top Labels
  - Plots the top 20 most used labels and the number of issues with those labels
- Simple Unlabeling Analysis
  - Calculates the average number of unlabeling events per issue
  - Plots the number of issues by the number of unlabeling events in those issues
- Plot of New Issues Over Time For Label
  - Plots the number of new issues created with a user inputted label by time (does nothing if no label is input)

### Analysis Three:

The third feature aims to analyze the issue lifecycle: Created → Closed → Reopened. The timestamp for these events are used to plot various graphs which draw interesting insights:
```
python run.py --feature 3
```

The feature provides following:
- Issue lifecycle analysis
  - Plots a gantt chart to provide the entire lifecycle of an Issue from its creation to closing till reopening.
  - Facilitates comparative analysis of multiple issues to identify patterns and bottlenecks.
- Issue's reopening trends
  - Plots a bar graph to display issue-reopening trends over time.
  - Helps understand:
    - Peaks in issue reopenings.
    - Seasonal or periodic patterns in issue reoccurrence.
- Time taken to reopen analysis
  - Plots a donut chart which reveals insights into the speed of issue reopening after closure.
  - Helps to identify whether issues are being addressed promptly or if delays exist in their resolution.
