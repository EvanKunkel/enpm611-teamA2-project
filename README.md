# ENPM611 Project Team A2

This project contains a set of analytical tools that can be used to generate insights on issues in the [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) github repository.

## Install dependencies

In the root directory of the application, create a virtual environment, activate that environment, and install the dependencies like so:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run an analysis

With everything set up, you should be able to run the existing example analysis:

```
python run.py --feature 0
```

That will output basic information about the issues to the command line.

### Analysis One:

### Analysis Two:

The second feature provides insights on the issues based off of their labels. The basic capabilities of the feature can be ran with the following command:
```
python run.py --feature 2
```
Additional insights can be generated by passing a label as an argument, as follows:
```
python run.py --feature 2 --label LABEL_NAME
```
where `LABEL_NAME` is the name of the label (e.g. `"Bug"` or `"New Feature"`).

The feature provides the following analytics.
- Simple Label Analysis
  - Calculates the total number of labels amongst all issues
  - Finds the number of issues with the user inputted label (all by default)
- Plot of Top Labels
  - Plots the top 20 most used labels and the number of issues with those labels
- Simple Unlabeling Analysis
  - Calculates the average number of unlabeling events per issue
  - Plots the number of issues by the number of unlabeling events in those issues
- Plot of New Issues Over Time For Label
  - Plots the number of new issues created with a user inputted label by time (does nothing if no label is input)

### Analysis Three:
